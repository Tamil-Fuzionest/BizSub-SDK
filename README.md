```kotlin
import com.fuzionest.bizsub.SubscriptionActivity

// Example: Start subscription flow
val subscription = SubscriptionActivity(context)
subscription.startPayment(
    keyId = "rzp_test_key",          // Razorpay key
    orderId = "order_123",           // Order ID from your backend
    amount = "1000",                 // Amount in INR (paise format if required)
    planName = "Driver Gold Plan",   // Subscription plan name
    vehicleNo = "TN01AB1234",        // Driver‚Äôs vehicle number
